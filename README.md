This repo can be used to define a GitRepo in [Fleet (Continuous Delivery in Rancher)](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/deploy-apps-across-clusters/fleet)

It will push [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) to any K8s cluster managed by Rancher that you define with the GitRepo in Fleet.
